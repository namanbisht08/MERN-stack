   <h1>Outline of space science</h1>
   <br>
   <h3>Img 1 :</h3>
   <p>Space science <em><strong style="color: red">encompasses</strong></em> all of the scientific disciplines that involve space exploration and study natural phenomena and physical bodies occurring in outer space, such as space medicine and astrobiology</p>

    <p>Science is the underpinning theme of <em><strong style="color: red">ESA.</strong></em> It drives innovation and leads to progress and economic development. It inspires future generations of scientists and engineers, and it drives global information exchange and communication.</p>

    <p>What about the origin of the <em><strong style="color: red">Universe</strong></em> itself? If we could ‘see’ microwaves, the night sky would glow with the very first light ever released into space. This is the relic radiation of the Big Bang – the event that set the beginning to the Universe itself. With our space science missions we can tease out the details of the Universe’s earliest moments, seek out the very first stars and galaxies, and learn about the fabric of space and time. These incredible space observatories can also give us clues as to the future destiny of our Milky Way galaxy, and the Universe itself.</p>

    <p>ESA staff and <em><strong style="color: red">contractors</strong></em> work across Europe to make the dreams of our space scientists come true. Typically spacecraft are designed at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk in The Netherlands, with ESA managing the building of the spacecraft components and its scientific instruments by European industry and academia. The components are usually then brought together and tested under space conditions at ESTEC, before being launched from Europe's Spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. After launch, in most cases the spacecraft are operated from the European</p>
